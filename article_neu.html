         <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
            account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
            rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
            but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
            encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
            anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
            because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
            which toil and pain can procure him some great
            pleasure.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn1" id="rfn1">1</a></sup>
            To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
            has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
            that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with
            righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
            demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
            desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
            to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
            through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
            shrinking from toil and pain.
