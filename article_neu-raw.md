But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
and pain can procure him some great pleasure.[^1]\
To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
