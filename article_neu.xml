  <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
  account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
  explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
  rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
  encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
  anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
  because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
  which toil and pain can procure him some great
  pleasure.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>
  To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
  physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
  has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
  that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
  produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with
  righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
  demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
  desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
  to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
  through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
  shrinking from toil and pain.</p>
