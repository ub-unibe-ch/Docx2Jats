    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
    denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a
    complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
    the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
    happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
    because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
    pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
    painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
    to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure
    him some great pleasure.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>
    To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
    pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
    that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce
    with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
    desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
    to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
    shrinking from toil and pain.</p>
